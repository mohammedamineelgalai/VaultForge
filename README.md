## ROI Calculator

```
Typical Enterprise: 20 designers, 50 projects/year, 2000+ files/project

BEFORE VaultForge:
- Manual upload: 4h/project x 50 = 200h/year
- Copy Design: 2h/project x 50 = 100h/year  
- Orphan files: 1h/project x 50 = 50h/year
- Total: 350h/year x 20 designers = 7,000h/year

WITH VaultForge:
- Upload: 30min/project x 50 = 25h/year
- Copy Design: 15min/project x 50 = 12.5h/year
- Orphans: 0h (automatic)
- Total: 37.5h/year x 20 designers = 750h/year

SAVINGS: 6,250h/year = 312 person-days = ~$250,000/year (@$80/h)
